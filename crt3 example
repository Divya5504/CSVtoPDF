I've always wanted to tackle this kind of CRT problem but never had a project that required it... until now!

This approach requires no message shape with numbers, no api calls, no Process Properties and no scripting.

DPP-Counter: initialise to 1
Dump DPP-Counter: put DPP-Counter into context (e.g. output will be 1)
Map
Does the CRT lookup based on the value from the message shape
Increments DPP Counter (see https://community.boomi.com/s/question/0D51W00006As1GMSAZ/increment-of-dynamic-process-property-value)
CRT Index set: Checks that the output from the map includes a value from the CRT
True path: Loops back, resulting in the message shape outputting 2
False path: the lookup couldn't find a value for the latest index, so stops.
Process
