We had similar requirement to on-board new vendors without modifying or redeploying the process.

Presently the number of vendors is <50.

 

We defined a CRT with an arbitrary column ID in it. The values for these column contains ID1, ID2, ID3....

In Boomi process, we defined a message shape like below: (we defined ID1 - ID500 so it can handle upto 500 vendors - which is in our case, a far higher number)

 

After that we using map share to do the CRT lookup and getting Vendor details (vendor name, folder etc).

Then we are doing dataprocess --> Split to split the rows. In decision shape, we checking whether vendorname/folder is not empty. If it is not empty, we are using flow control to process each vendor.
