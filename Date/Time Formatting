Date/Time Formatting

When moving data from the source to a destination, you need to ensure that the field formatted correctly, not only on the destination end, but also your source. Should your source profile be defined as a character type, you can add a "Date Format" function within your map, which will take your Input Date String and format it based on an Input Mask and Output Mask:

0EM40000000N3OR

For other information about date/time formatting and syntax, please view Date/Time data type.

When you use date/time data type in a profile, you'll see there are preset formats like MMyyyydd and many others. The date/time formatting is used in map functions and properties as well. If you use more symbols than there are digits, it will be formatted appropriately:
 
d is day in month, 1-31. If you use d and it is the 7th, the result will be 7; dd and day is 7, result will be 07
D is day in year, 1-365 (or 366). If you use D and it is the 9th day of the year, the result will be 9; DD and it is the 9th day of the year, result will be 09; DDD will be 009
Note: while you can use as many symbols as you want e.g. dddd, but it wouldn't make sense since you'll produce 0031. If there's no specific purpose for it, there's no need to use more than what's necessary.

You can make your own date/time format using any combination of the syntax.

Note:The platform has an internal date/time format used in the map: yyyyMMdd HHmmss.SSS (e.g. 20190501 105321.941). If you want to use the current date and convert it to another date format, your input date mask needs to be yyyyMMdd HHmmss.SSS. If you get errors related to the date/time formatting, it is often because your input doesn't match the formatting, check your formatting again.
